# Socialite with lumen

It is a symple application where you will be able to learn how to use [Socialite](https://github.com/laravel/socialite) for social login. Though I am using return view, you will find a way out to attach social login with lumen. I have attached [Passport](https://github.com/dusterio/lumen-passport) for token baised authentication. 

N.B: If you need only token baised authentication you don't need to use [Socialite](https://github.com/laravel/socialite)
